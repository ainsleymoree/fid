<h1>About Grumpy Joes</h1>
<p>We get some days are tough. The worst part about tough days is having to act like you aren't having a bad day. Which is why here at Grumpy Joes we invite you to join us for a coffee any day, but especially the bad ones. We don't make anything sound happier than it is. Your In-Laws are in town? Order "My In-Laws are in Town" A.K.A. A bold dark espresso. Add "and they came unanncounced" and we will add an alcohol of your choice. Check out our menu for more options.</p>
