<h1>About Ainsley</h1>
<p>Ainsley Moree is a dual enrolled college student at Seminole State College of Florida. She is currently studying to get a general A.A. but may go back to school to get a B.A. in a digital arts field.
  <br>She has minimal job experience, but is <em>eager</em> to learn as much as she can/needs to achieve her careeer goals. She enjoys the digital marketing pathway the most, as she loves to collaborate with people and help them acheive their art dreams. As of now she has minimal experience with digital art programs like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, HTML, and Procreate. She has self taught experince with painting and has even done a few murals for people. She has a <strong>passion</strong> for taking an idea that someone has in their head and turning it into a reality. Whether that be a picture, painting, graphic design, etc. she enjoys it all. She enjoys physical art more than digital, but that is mainly due to her lack of knowledge with digital art mediums. As peviously mentioned, she is very eager to continue to grow and learn more about the digital art world.</p>
